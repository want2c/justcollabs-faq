# I can't see the collaboration I was invited to confirm

If you received a notification about a collaboration request but can't find it in your dashboard, here are the most common solutions:

## **Check Your Collaboration Dashboard**

1. **Go to Your Dashboard**: Navigate to the main collaboration section
2. **Look for Pending Requests**: Check the "Pending Requests" section specifically
3. **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes a simple page refresh loads new requests
4. **Check Notifications**: Look for any unread notification bells or alerts

## **Common Visibility Issues**

### **Handle Mismatch**
- **Issue**: The collaboration was created with a slightly different version of your handle
- **Solution**: Check if you have variations of your username (@username vs @username_official)
- **Fix**: Contact the person who sent it to verify the exact handle they used

### **Platform Confusion**
- **Issue**: Collaboration was sent to your Twitter handle but you joined with your Bluesky handle
- **Solution**: Check both platform accounts in your profile settings
- **Fix**: Make sure all your social media handles are properly linked in your profile

### **Notification Delay**
- **Issue**: System notifications can sometimes have a brief delay
- **Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes and refresh your dashboard
- **Fix**: Check your email for backup notifications

## **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### **Browser Issues**
1. **Clear Cache**: Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. **Try Incognito**: Open the site in a private/incognito window
3. **Different Browser**: Test with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
4. **Disable Extensions**: Turn off ad blockers or other extensions temporarily

### **Account Verification**
1. **Profile Complete**: Ensure your profile is fully set up
2. **Email Verified**: Check that your email address is confirmed
3. **Handle Accuracy**: Verify your social media handles are spelled correctly

### **Mobile vs Desktop**
- **Try Both Platforms**: Check on both mobile and desktop
- **App vs Browser**: If using mobile, try the browser version
- **Mobile Responsive**: Some features may display differently on mobile

## **Still Can't Find It?**

### **Contact the Sender**
1. Ask them to **resend the collaboration request**
2. Verify they used the **correct handle**
3. Check if the **collaboration URL is working**
4. Ask for a **screenshot** of what they sent

### **Check Your Profile Settings**
1. **Privacy Settings**: Ensure you can receive collaboration requests
2. **Notification Settings**: Check if collaboration notifications are enabled
3. **Account Status**: Make sure your account is in good standing

### **Contact Support**
