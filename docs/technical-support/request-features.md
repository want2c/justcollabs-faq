# Can I request new features or report bugs?

Absolutely! We welcome your suggestions for new features and reports of any bugs you might find. Your input is valuable in helping us make JustCollabs better for everyone.

Here's how you can share your ideas or report issues:

1. **Via the Contact Support Form (if logged in):**
   - When you're logged into your JustCollabs account, look for a "Contact Support" option (usually in your dashboard).
   - You can select "Feedback" from the category dropdown to suggest new features or improvements.
   - Select "Bug" to report any technical issues or errors you encounter. Please provide as much detail as possible, including what you were doing when the bug occurred, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

2. **By Email:**
   - You can email your feature requests, general feedback, or detailed bug reports to **admin@justcollabs.com**.
   - For bug reports, please include:
     - Your username and the email associated with your account.
     - A clear description of the bug.
     - Steps to reproduce the bug, if possible.
     - The type of device and browser you were using.
     - Screenshots, if they help illustrate the problem.

While we have a policy regarding unsolicited *new product* ideas, we are always eager to hear your feedback on our *existing platform* and how we can improve it. We appreciate you taking the time to help us enhance JustCollabs!
