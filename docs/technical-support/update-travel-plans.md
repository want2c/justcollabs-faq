# How do I update my travel plans or availability?

You can easily manage your travel plans, which in turn defines your availability in different locations, through a dedicated "Travel Plans" section in your account settings.

1. **Accessing Travel Plans:**
   - Navigate to your account settings.
   - Look for a menu item or section specifically labeled "Travel Plans."

2. **Adding a New Travel Plan:**
   - You'll find an "Add Trip" or similar button.
   - You can then specify:
     - **Destination:** Select the Country and then the City you plan to visit.
     - **Dates:** Choose your Start Date and End Date for the trip.
   - The system will prevent you from adding plans with dates in the past or with overlapping date ranges for different trips.

3. **Viewing and Editing Existing Plans:**
   - All your current and future travel plans will be listed.
   - Each plan will have options to "Edit" or "Delete" it.
   - Editing allows you to change the destination or dates of an existing plan.

4. **How Travel Plans Relate to Availability:**
   - Your travel plans directly indicate your availability for collaborations in those specified locations during the dates you've set.
   - When other users search, your profile will appear as "visiting" or "traveling to" those locations based on your active travel plans.
   - If you don't have any travel plans set for a particular period, you are generally assumed to be available in your primary "home city" (if you've set one in your main profile).
   - There isn't a separate toggle for general "availability" outside of defining where and when you will be via your travel plans. Keeping your travel plans accurate is the best way to manage how your availability is shown to others.

By keeping your travel plans up-to-date, you ensure that other creators can accurately see when and where you might be available for collaborations.
