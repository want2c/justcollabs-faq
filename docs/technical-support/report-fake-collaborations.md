Helping us maintain a trustworthy platform is crucial for everyone's success. Here's how to report problematic collaborations:

## **When to Report Collaborations**

- 🚫 **Fake Collaborations**: Claims of collaborations that never happened
- ❌ **Inappropriate Content**: Links to content that violates community guidelines
- 🔄 **Spam Requests**: Bulk or automated collaboration requests
- 👤 **Identity Issues**: Someone claiming to be involved who wasn't
- ⚠️ **Suspicious Patterns**: Multiple questionable requests from the same user

## **How to Flag Individual Collaborations**

### **From Your Dashboard:**
1. Go to your collaboration dashboard
2. Find the questionable collaboration request
3. Click the **"Flag"** button or report icon
4. Select the reason from the dropdown menu
