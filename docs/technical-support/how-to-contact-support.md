# How do I contact support?

We offer a couple of ways to get in touch with our support team:

1. **Contact Support Form (When Logged In):**
   - If you are logged into your JustCollabs account, you should find a "Contact Support" option, in your dashboard area.
   - This form allows you to categorize your request (e.g., feedback, bug report, help request) and send details directly to our team. Someone from our team will get back to you as soon as possible.

2. **Email Support:**
   - For general inquiries, technical support, feedback, or if you're having trouble with your account, you can email us directly at **admin@justcollabs.com**.

When contacting support, please provide as much detail as possible about your issue or question so we can assist you more effectively. If it's about a specific problem, including your username, the email address associated with your account, and any relevant screenshots (if applicable via email) can be very helpful.
