# What should I do if I see inappropriate content?

If you see content on JustCollabs that you believe violates our platform rules (as outlined in our Terms of Service, especially the Content Standards in Section 10), or if you encounter behavior that makes you uncomfortable, please report it immediately. We take such reports seriously.

Here are the ways you can report inappropriate content or conduct:

1. **Use In-Platform Reporting Tools:**
   - We have features that allow you to report specific users or content directly on the platform. Look for "Report" buttons or options on user profiles or within other relevant areas.
   - When you report, you'll typically be asked to choose a reason (e.g., Spam, Harassment, Inappropriate Content, Impersonation) and provide additional details.

2. **Email Us Directly:**
   - For any type of inappropriate content, abuse, or violations of our Terms of Service, you can email us at **admin@justcollabs.com**.
   - **For very serious violations like suspected Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) or content related to Prostitution/Sex Trafficking, it is crucial to email admin@justcollabs.com promptly.**

**When you make a report, please provide as much information as possible, such as:**

- The username of the person or a clear description of the content you are reporting.
- Where you saw the content (e.g., on a specific profile page, in a message).
- Why you believe it is inappropriate or violates our rules.
- The date and time you saw it.
- Any supporting evidence.

We will investigate all reports and take appropriate action in accordance with our policies, which may include content removal, warnings, or account suspension/termination. Your help in reporting such content is vital for maintaining a safe and respectful community.
