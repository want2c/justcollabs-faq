# How do I showcase my past collaborations on my profile?

Showcasing your collaborations is essential for building credibility and attracting new opportunities. Here's how to do it:

## **Adding Past Collaborations**

1. **Go to Collaboration Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your collaboration dashboard from your profile menu
   - Click "Add Collaboration" to create a new collaboration entry

2. **Enter Collaboration Details**
   - **Post URL**: Link to the content you collaborated on (Twitter, Bluesky, etc.)
   - **Collaborators**: Add the social media handles of everyone who worked on the project

3. **Invite Collaborators**
   - If they're already on JustCollabs: They'll receive a notification to confirm
   - If they're not on the platform: You'll get an invitation message to share with them

## **What Happens After Confirmation**

✅ **Verified Badge**: Confirmed collaborations show as "verified" on your profile
📈 **Search Boost**: You'll rank higher in search results
🤝 **Connection Count**: Your total connections increase
🔗 **Clickable Links**: Others can view the actual collaboration content

## **Pro Tips for Maximum Impact**

🎯 **Start with recent work**: Add your most recent and impressive collaborations first
👥 **Invite everyone**: Even small collaborations count toward your credibility
🔄 **Keep it updated**: Regularly add new collaborations as you create them

**Remember**: The more verified collaborations you have, the higher you'll appear in searches and the more likely others are to want to work with you!
