# How do collaboration confirmations work?

JustCollabs uses a secure, multi-step confirmation process to ensure all collaborations are genuine and verified.

## **The Confirmation Workflow**

### **Step 1: Collaboration Request**
- Someone adds a collaboration that includes your handle
- You receive a notification in your dashboard
- The collaboration shows as "pending" until you respond

### **Step 2: Review & Verify**
- You can see the post URL and collaboration details
- Click the link to verify the content actually exists
- Check that you were genuinely involved in creating that content

### **Step 3: Confirm or Deny**
- **Confirm**: If you participated in the collaboration, click "Confirm"
- **Deny**: If you didn't collaborate on this content, click "Deny"
- **Flag**: If it seems fake or inappropriate, use the flag option

### **Step 4: Mutual Verification**
- Both parties must confirm for the collaboration to be verified
- Only confirmed collaborations count toward your connection total
- Confirmed collaborations appear on both profiles with a verified badge

## **Security Features**

- üõ°Ô∏è **Community Flagging**: Users can report fake or inappropriate collaborations
- üëÅÔ∏è **Admin Review**: Flagged collaborations get reviewed by our moderation team
- ‚úÖ **Mutual Confirmation**: Both parties must agree for verification

## **What Shows on Your Profile**

**Before Confirmation:**
- Pending collaborations don't count toward your total
- They don't appear on your public profile
- They don't boost your search ranking

**After Confirmation:**
- ‚úÖ Verified collaboration appears with a confirmation badge
- üìà Your connection count increases
- üîç Your search ranking improves
- üîó Others can click to view the actual collaboration content

## **Best Practices**

- **Always verify the content** before confirming
- **Only confirm genuine collaborations** you actually participated in
- **Flag suspicious requests** to help keep the platform trustworthy
- **Respond promptly** to help others build their verified networks

**Remember**: The confirmation system protects everyone by ensuring only real collaborations get verified, which maintains the integrity and value of connections on JustCollabs!
