# Can I add collaborations with creators who aren't on the platform yet?

**Yes, absolutely!** This is actually one of the best ways to grow your connections and help expand the JustCollabs community.

## **How It Works**

1. **Add the Collaboration Normally**
   - Go to "Add Collaboration" in your dashboard
   - Enter the post URL and collaboration details
   - Include the Twitter/Bluesky handles of creators not yet on the platform

2. **System Checks for Existing Users**
   - JustCollabs automatically checks if those handles belong to existing users
   - Existing users get immediate collaboration requests
   - Non-users are marked as "pending invites"

3. **Get Your Invitation Message**
   - The system generates a personalized invite message for each platform
   - You'll see exactly what to send and where to send it

## **What Happens When They Join**

   - ✅ **Automatic Matching**: When they sign up with the same social media handle, the system connects them to your collaboration request
   - 🔔 **Instant Notification**: They'll immediately see your collaboration request to confirm
   - 🤝 **Mutual Benefit**: Once confirmed, you both get the connection credit and search boost
   - 🌟 **Network Growth**: They become part of the JustCollabs community

## **Strategic Benefits**

   - 📈 **Higher Search Ranking**: Even pending collaborations show your activity level
   - 👥 **Community Growth**: You help expand the platform with quality creators
   - 🎯 **Future Opportunities**: When they join, you'll be their first connection

**Pro Tip**: Focus on inviting creators you've genuinely worked with and who would benefit from joining a professional creator network. Quality connections are always better than quantity!
