# What's the difference between a public and private profile?

On JustCollabs, the concept of "public" vs. "private" profiles works a bit differently than on some other social platforms. Here's a breakdown:

- **Visibility Within the Platform:** Once your profile is verified, it is generally visible to other verified JustCollabs members. This is essential for the platform's purpose of helping creators find each other for collaborations.

- **No "Fully Public to Internet" Option (by default):** Your JustCollabs profile isn't visible to anyone on the internet like a public social media page. Visibility is primarily contained within the network of logged-in, verified users within the platform.

- **No "Fully Private/Invisible Mode" from other members:** You are visible only to those members that matches your gender preferences, there is no invisible mode at the moment, however you are free to Block any user at any time and that will prevent them from seeing your profile.

- **Granular Privacy Controls:** You do have some control over specific pieces of information. For example, you have the option to hide your age from being displayed on your profile. If you are a performer you have the option to fill up as much information as you need from your performer profile.

- **Verification is Key:** Before verification, your profile's visibility and functionality will be limited. Getting verified is what grants you full access and visibility within the JustCollabs community.

**In essence:**

- Think of a **"verified profile"** as being "public" *within the JustCollabs network* of other verified creators.
- There isn't a distinct "private profile" mode that makes you invisible to other members. Privacy is more about what specific details you choose to share or hide (like your age) and the fact that the platform itself is a members-only environment for verified creators.

You can manage who you interact with through blocking features if needed, but general profile visibility is geared towards enabling connections.
