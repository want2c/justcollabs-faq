# What does the distance badge on profiles mean?

The **distance badge** is a small gray indicator that appears on creator profile cards when you're searching beyond your exact city. Here's what it means:

## **Badge Appearance**

The distance badge appears as: <img src={DistanceBadge} alt="Distance badge example" width="100" />

- **Small gray badge** in the top-left corner of profile photos
- **White text** showing the distance (e.g., "25km", "45mi")
- **Only visible** when using the nearby distance slider
- **Automatically formatted** in your preferred units (km or miles)

## **When You See Distance Badges**

- ‚úÖ **Nearby Search**: Only appears when you've expanded beyond "exact city"
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Cities**: When creators are based in surrounding areas
- ‚úÖ **Travel Mode**: When viewing creators in cities you plan to visit
- ‚ùå **Exact City**: No badges shown for creators in your selected city

## **Distance Calculation**

The system calculates distance:
- **City to City**: Between the centers of both cities
- **Straight Line**: "As the crow flies" measurement

## **Using Distance Info for Planning**

**25-50km (15-30mi):**
- Easy day trip distance
- Often same metro area
- Minimal additional travel cost

**60-100km (40-60mi):**
- Regional collaboration opportunities
- May require planning overnight stay
- Still within reasonable travel range

**100km+ (60mi+):**
- Longer distance collaboration
- Consider multi-day projects
- Factor in travel time and costs

## **Pro Tips**

- üí° **Plan Efficiently**: Group collaborations by distance to minimize travel
- üìç **Metro Areas**: Creators 20-30km away might be more accessible than the distance suggests
- üöó **Transportation**: Consider public transit availability to nearby cities

**Remember**: Distance badges help you make informed decisions about collaboration feasibility and travel planning!
