# How do I find creators in nearby cities?

Finding creators in nearby cities is easy with our **distance discovery feature**! This helps you connect with creators you might be able to meet without traveling far.

## **Using the Distance Slider**

When browsing creators, you'll see a **"Nearby" slider** at the top of the results:

- 🎯 **Exact City Only**: Shows only creators in your selected city
- 📍 **30-50km radius**: Includes creators in nearby towns and suburbs
- 🌍 **60-100km radius**: Expands to neighboring cities and metro areas
- 🚗 **90-150km radius**: Covers a wider regional area (day trip distance)

## **How It Works**

1. **Select Your City**: Choose the city you want to search in (your home city or travel destination)
2. **Adjust the Distance**: Move the slider to your preferred radius
3. **Real-Time Results**: The creator list updates automatically as you change the distance
4. **Distance Badges**: See exactly how far each creator is from your selected city

## **Visual Indicators**

Each creator card shows:
- **Distance Badge**: Small gray badge showing "25km", "45km", etc.
- **Location Info**: Their home city or current travel location
- **Travel Status**: Whether they're based there or visiting

## **Strategic Benefits**

- 🚗 **Easy Meetups**: Find creators within driving distance
- 🌆 **Metro Area Coverage**: Discover creators in the broader city region
- ✈️ **Reduce Travel Costs**: Collaborate closer to home
- 🤝 **Local Networks**: Build connections in your geographic area
