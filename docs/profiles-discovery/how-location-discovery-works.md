# How does the location-based discovery work?

It's simple!

1. **Set Your Home City:** In your profile, you set your main "home base" city. Profiles are displayed according to the city you set. Your GPS location is not shared with us at any moment, we value your privacy and safety.

2. **Add Travel Plans (Optional):** If you're traveling, you can add specific cities and dates to your "Travel Plans."

3. **Discover Creators:**
   - You can then search for creators who are based in your home city.
   - You can also search for creators in cities you plan to visit, or see who else will be traveling there at the same time as you.

This helps you find potential collaborators nearby or in places you'll be visiting.
