# Can I hide my profile from certain users?

Yes, you can prevent specific users from seeing your profile and interacting with you by **blocking** them.

**How it Works:** When you block another user:
- They will no longer be able to view your profile.
- You will no longer see their profile in search results or be able to view theirs.
- Any existing messages between you and the blocked user will be deleted.
- They will not be able to send you any new messages.

**Managing Blocks:** You can see a list of users you've blocked in your account settings and can choose to unblock them if you wish.

This feature gives you control over who can access your profile and interact with you on JustCollabs.
