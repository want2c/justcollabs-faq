# How do travel plans work and who can see them?

Travel plans help you connect with creators in different locations:

1. **How They Work:**
   - You can add a "Travel Plan" in your profile settings for any city you intend to visit.
   - You'll specify the destination (city and country) and your start and end dates for the trip.

2. **Who Can See Them:**
   - **Other Verified Users:** Your travel plans are visible to other verified JustCollabs members when they are browsing profiles or searching for collaborators.
   - **In Searches:** If another creator is searching for collaborators in a city you've listed in your travel plans, your profile may appear in their results, indicating you'll be visiting.
   - **On Your Profile:** Your upcoming travel plans are typically displayed on your profile page so others can see where you'll be traveling.
   - **Contextual Badges:** When others view profiles in a specific city, badges might indicate if a user is based in that city, "Visiting now," "Visiting soon," or "visiting during your trip".

The purpose of sharing travel plans is to maximize your opportunities to find collaborators in different locations. There isn't a feature to make individual travel plans private; they are designed to be part of the discovery process.
