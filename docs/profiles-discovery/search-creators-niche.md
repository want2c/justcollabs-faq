# Can I search for creators in a specific niche or region?

Yes, absolutely! JustCollabs offers robust search filters to help you find the right collaborators:

1. **By Region/City:**
   - You can easily browse or search for creators based in a specific city. This can be your home city, a city you're planning to travel to, or any other city you're interested in.

2. **By Niche, Role, and Specific Attributes:**
   - **Roles:** You can filter by the roles creators have selected for themselves (e.g., Performer, Photographer, Director, etc.).
   - **Performer-Specific Attributes:** If you're looking for performers, you can drill down further with filters for:
     - Preferences for showing face.
     - Physical characteristics (e.g., gender, age, body type, etc).
     - Preferred collaboration locations (e.g., studio, hotel).
     - Specific performer roles (e.g., for gay performers: top, bottom, etc).
     - Experience level.
     - Keywords from their bio.

These filters allow you to narrow down your search and find creators who match your specific collaboration needs and preferences.
