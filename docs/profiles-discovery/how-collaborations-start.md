# How do collaborations get started on the platform?

Starting a collaboration on JustCollabs is very easy:

1. **Search:** Use the "Find Collabs" search page to find creators who match your interests. You can filter by location (their home city or where they are traveling), their roles (e.g., performer, photographer), specific attributes if they're a performer, and more.

2. **Review Profiles:** Check out the profiles of creators who seem like a good match to learn more about them, their work (via linked platforms), and their collaboration preferences.

3. **Chat:** Once you find someone you'd like to collaborate with, the primary way to get in touch is by sending them a direct message through our built-in chat system. You can introduce yourself, express your interest in collaborating, and discuss potential ideas. Use the chat to discuss the specifics of your proposed collaboration, such as concepts, dates, locations, compensation (if applicable), and any other important details.

4. **Project Planning:**
   - Once you've found a potential collaborator, you can use the platform to plan your project.
   - This includes discussing roles, expectations, and any specific requirements.

5. **Collaboration Management:**
   - The platform provides tools to manage your collaboration, including scheduling and communication features.
   - You can track the progress of your collaboration and make adjustments as needed.

6. **Post-Collaboration:**
   - After the collaboration, you can provide feedback and maintain connections for future projects.
   - The platform encourages ongoing relationships between creators.

This structured approach helps ensure that collaborations are well-organized and successful.
