# Can I showcase NSFW content?

Your profile image and cover must be SFW, but you can link to NSFW content or embed previews from platforms like Bluesky. We aim to balance freedom of expression with platform safety.

If you want to show NSFW please connect your Bluesky account and it will be displayed in your profile page.
