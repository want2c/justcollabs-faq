# How do I set up my profile?

After you sign up and verify your email, a basic profile is automatically created. You'll then be guided to complete your profile, which involves:

- **Age Verification:** Confirming you are 18 years or older.
- **Location:** Setting your home city and country. This is crucial for location-based discovery.
- **Collaboration Preferences:** Defining what kind of collaborations you're looking for.
- **Social Links:** Connecting your Twitter or Bluesky accounts and providing a link to your content platform (e.g., OnlyFans page). This helps with verification and showcasing your work.
- **Bio & Details:** Adding a bio to describe yourself and what you offer.
- **Travel Plans:** You can add any upcoming travel dates and destinations to find collaborators in other locations.

A complete and accurate profile increases your chances of getting verified and finding suitable collaborators.
