# How does the verification process work?

Our verification process is designed to ensure safety and legitimacy on the platform. Here's generally how it works:

1. **Initial Sign-up & Email Verification:** After creating your account with your email (or social login), you'll first need to verify your email address.

2. **Profile Completion:** You'll need to complete your profile with accurate information, including your age (you must be 18 or older), nickname, gender, location, and a bio.

3. **Identity Verification Links:** A key part of verification is linking to your existing public profiles. This typically involves:
   - Connecting your X (formerly Twitter) or Bluesky account.
   - Providing a valid link to your page on anything showcasing your portfolio, in case of a performer role OnlyFans, Fansly, etc. would be enough.

   These links help us confirm your identity as a content creator.

4. **Review Process:** Once your profile is complete and links are provided, your information will be submitted for review by our team.

5. **Approval or Denial:**
   - If approved, your profile will be marked as "Verified," and you'll gain full access to JustCollabs features, including discovering other verified creators, using travel mode and connecting with others.
   - If denied, you will be notified, often with a reason. You can then update your profile information and re-apply for verification. Common reasons for denial include incomplete profiles or issues with the provided links.

The goal is to create a trusted environment for creators to connect.
