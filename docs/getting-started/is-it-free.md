# Is it free to use?

Yes for now, all features on JustCollabs are completely free to use for verified members while we're in our early access/beta phase. In the future, we plan to introduce optional **Premium Services** that offer enhanced features and benefits for a monthly subscription.

Early adopters will get in the ambassador program in the future which will allow them to have any future premium services for free.
