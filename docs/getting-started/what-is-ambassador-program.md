# What's the ambassador program tailored for early adopters?

To thank our early supporters, we're launching an **Ambassador Program**. The **first 20 verified users in each city** who select that city as their **home base** will automatically be granted **complimentary access to premium features** when they launch. 

## How does the ambassador program works?

- Each city can have **up to 20 Ambassadors**.
- To qualify, you must be one of the **first 20 verified members** who list a specific city as your **home base**.
- Once a city reaches its 20-Ambassador limit, any new users selecting that city **will not** be eligible for free premium access anymore.
- **Note:** Your Ambassador status is tied to your original home base city. If you later change your home base to a city that has already reached the 20-Ambassador cap, you may lose your complimentary premium access.
