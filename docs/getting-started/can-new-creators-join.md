# Can I join if I'm new to content creation?

Yes, you can join JustCollabs even if you are new to content creation. While we aim to be a platform for professional networking, we understand that everyone starts somewhere. Our platform includes options for performers to specify their experience level (including "beginner"). The key requirement is to successfully complete the verification process, which typically involves linking to an active content platform or social media profile (like Twitter or Bluesky) that demonstrates your identity and commitment as a creator. As long as you are 18 or older and can meet the verification criteria, you are welcome to join and start building your network.
