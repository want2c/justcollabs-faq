# Can I block or report other users?

Yes, absolutely. Your safety and comfort are important to us.

- **Blocking Users:** If you wish to stop another user from contacting you or seeing your full profile details, you can block them directly from their profile page. When you block someone, any existing messages between you will be deleted. You can manage your blocked users list in your account settings.
- **Reporting Users/Content:** If you encounter a user or content that violates our community guidelines, or for any other safety concern, you can report them. This can be done from their profile page. Reporting a user will also automatically block them for you. Our team will review all reports and take appropriate action based on our policies. For severe violations like CSAM, you can also contact us directly at admin@justcollabs.com.
