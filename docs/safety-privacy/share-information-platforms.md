# Do you share my information with other platforms?

Your privacy is important to us. We do not sell your personal information to other platforms.

Here's how we handle your data regarding third parties:

- **Operational Service Providers:** We work with trusted third-party vendors for essential services like hosting, email delivery, analytics (like Google Analytics), and content moderation. These providers only get the information necessary to perform their functions for JustCollabs and are expected to protect your data.
- **Linked Accounts (Your Choice):** If you choose to connect your social media accounts (like X/Twitter or Bluesky) for verification or to display content, or if you add links to your external content platforms, that information is shared as per the functionality of those links.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required by law, to comply with a legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of JustCollabs, our users, or the public.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger or acquisition, your information might be transferred as part of our business assets.

We encourage you to review our full Privacy Policy for detailed information. We do not share your JustCollabs profile data with other platforms for their independent marketing purposes.
