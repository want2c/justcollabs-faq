We are committed to fostering a safe and respectful community on JustCollabs. Harassment is strictly prohibited by our Terms of Service.

If you encounter harassment from another user:

1. **Report the User:** Please report the user to us. You can do this from their profile page. When you report a user, this also automatically blocks them for you.
   - Provide as much detail as possible in your report, including the nature of the harassment and any relevant context.
   - **Contact Support:** For any abuse, including harassment, you can also email us directly at admin@justcollabs.com.

**What We Do:**

- We take all reports of harassment seriously and will investigate them.
- Based on our investigation, we will take appropriate action, which can include issuing warnings, temporarily suspending, or permanently terminating the offending user's account, in accordance with our Terms of Service.
- We cooperate with law enforcement if illegal activities are involved.

Your safety is a priority. Please use the block and report tools to help us maintain a positive environment.
