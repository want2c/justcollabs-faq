# What safety tips do you recommend for meeting collaborators?

While JustCollabs facilitates connections, your safety during in-person meetings is your responsibility. We encourage all users to be cautious and take sensible precautions. Here are some tips we recommend:

- **Get to Know Them Online First:**
    - Use the JustCollabs messaging system to chat and get a feel for the person before agreeing to meet.
        - Check their JustCollabs profile thoroughly. Look for the completeness of their profile, and any linked social media or content platforms.
        - Consider a video call before meeting in person. This can help you gauge their professionalism and confirm they are who they say they are.
- **Verify Information (To the Extent Possible):**
    - While JustCollabs has a verification process, it's wise to see if their online presence across different platforms is consistent if they've shared those links.
    - Be wary if details don't add up or if they are hesitant to share information that would normally be part of a professional collaboration discussion.
- **Meet in a Public Place First:**
    - For an initial meeting, choose a public place where others are around. Avoid going to a private residence or isolated location immediately.
    - Consider this first meeting a "vibe check" or a chance to discuss collaboration details and boundaries in a neutral setting.
- **Inform Someone You Trust:**
    - Let a friend, family member, or another trusted contact know your plans: who you are meeting, where you are going, and when you expect to be back.
    - Arrange to check in with them at a set time.
    - Share your live location with them via your phone if possible.
- **Trust Your Instincts:**
    - If something feels off or makes you uncomfortable at any point (online or in person), do not proceed with the meeting or collaboration.
    - You are never obligated to go through with something if you have a bad feeling. It's okay to change your mind or leave a situation if you feel unsafe.
- **Discuss Boundaries and Expectations Clearly Beforehand:**
    - Before the actual collaboration (especially if it involves content creation), have a clear discussion about consent, boundaries, what will be filmed, how content will be used, compensation (if any), and any other important details.
    - Consider putting key terms in writing (even a simple email summary) so everyone is on the same page.
- **Handle Your Own Transportation:**
    - Arrange your own transportation to and from the meeting location so you are not dependent on the other person.
- **Keep Personal Information Private Initially:**
    - Don't share overly personal information (like your exact home address) until you've built a level of trust.
- **If You Feel Unsafe, Leave and Report:**
    - If a situation becomes uncomfortable or unsafe, remove yourself immediately.
    - Report any inappropriate behavior or safety concerns to JustCollabs through the platform's reporting tools or by emailing admin@justcollabs.com.

While JustCollabs aims to connect verified creators, always prioritize your personal safety and make informed decisions when arranging offline collaborations.
