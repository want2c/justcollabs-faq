# Who can see my profile?

Your profile's visibility on JustCollabs primarily depends on your verification status and interactions with other users:

- **Verified Users:** Once your profile is verified, it becomes discoverable by other verified users on the platform. They can see your profile information, including your bio, photos, location, travel plans, and other details you've shared, to help find potential collaborators.
- **Unverified Users:** If your profile is not yet verified, or if your verification is pending or denied, your profile will generally not be visible to other users (except yourself). You also won't be able to view other users' profiles until you are verified.
- **Blocking:** You can block any user. If you block someone (or they block you), you will not be able to see each other's profiles or interact.
- **Age Visibility:** You have the option to hide your specific age from being displayed on your profile, even though your birth date is used for age verification.
- **General Public:** The platform is designed as a network for its registered and verified members. Profiles are not generally visible to the public internet or search engines outside of what might be showcased on our main landing pages.

The goal is to create a trusted environment where verified creators can connect.
