# Is JustCollabs safe for adult content creators?

JustCollabs is designed with safety in mind for adult content creators. Key measures include:

- **Mandatory Verification:** All users undergo a verification process (email, social media identity, age 18+) to ensure legitimacy before gaining full access.
- **Strict Community Guidelines & Content Policies:** We have detailed terms of service that prohibit illegal activities, harassment, non-consensual content, and exploitation. Violations can lead to content removal and account termination.
- **Reporting Mechanisms:** Users can report content or users that violate our policies.
- **Technical Safeguards:** We implement security measures like HTTPS, and data protection practices.
- **Focus on Professionalism:** The platform aims to foster a professional environment for collaboration.

While we take significant steps to create a safer space, users need to exercise their own judgment and follow best practices for online interactions and real-world meetups.
