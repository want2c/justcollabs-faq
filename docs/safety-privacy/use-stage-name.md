# Can I use a stage name or alias?

Yes, JustCollabs is designed for you to use the name you're known by professionally.

- When you sign up, you'll choose a **username/nickname**. This is the name that will be displayed on your profile and how other users will primarily identify you on the platform.
- Think of this as your stage name or the alias you use for your content creation.
- While we have a verification process to ensure safety and confirm you are over 18 (which might involve checking identity through linked social accounts), your legal name is not publicly displayed on your JustCollabs profile.
